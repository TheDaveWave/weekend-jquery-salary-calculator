# Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This application allows for the user to add employees and their respective employee info such as their `First Name`,
`Last Name`, `Employeed ID number`, `Job Title`, and `Annual Salary`. 

The information will be formatted to a table and will calculated the `Total Monthly Cost` for the user.
If the `Total Monthly Cost` exceeds $20,000, the part of the table containing the `Total Monthly Cost` will change to red,
notifying the user that the cost is too high.

## Prerequisites

- [jQuery.js](https://jquery.com/download/)

## Usage

1. The user can put their employees' info into the `input` boxes one at a time.
2. All `input` boxes must be filled in order to add a new employee into the table.
   - The user will be notified if a box is left blank.
3. Once the `input` boxes are filled the user can click the `submit button` to add the employee to the table.
4. When an employee is added to the table, the `total monthly cost` will automatically be calculated.
5. For each employee row that is created, there is a `delete button` the user may click to delete that employee data.
    The data that is deleted will recalculate the `total monthly cost`.
6. If the user wants to start with a clean slate after adding employee data to the table there is an optional `clear button`.
    The `clear button` will erase all the employee data from the table and will act as a fresh start.
